Earthquakes cause deaths and destruction.  The technologies used in the laboratory to simulate and collect earthquake data have improved. In this study we predict the time remaining for imminent laboratory earthquakes more accurately {\em (or prove our data model or technology improvement is not helping)} than a 2017 Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) study\cite{Bertrand}.  We analyze the data for patterns using geological subject matter expertise, statistical methods and natural intuition. We design a statistical algorithm to model the patterns and predict the time remaining until a laboratory earthquake will occur for given test data. We compare predicted versus actual time remaining to determine our accuracy.

We predicted impending laboratory earthquakes with {\em accuracy score , hypothesis, statistical results including pvalue/confidence interval and relevent scores are tbd}.

The evidence of this experiment suggests {\em final results are work in progress}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
%1 Paragraph Motivtion (Sets General problem domain)
In August 2017 LANL conducted an experiment which predicted the remaining time until \emph{laboratory} earthquakes occur with 90\% accuracy\cite{Bertrand}. Since then there have been improvements in the technology used to collect and measure seismic signal data{\em (additional facts to be added?)}. There have also been improvements in computing power{\em (additional facts to be added?)}. Los Alamos   \par

%1 Paragraph Problem Statement (Specific Problem solved by the work)
Given seismic signal data with considerably more a-periodic laboratory earthquake failures and modern computing hardware; we improve on the Los Alamos study\cite{Bertrand} to determine when laboratory earthquakes will occur.

Data was attained from a Kaggle Competition sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory:  www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction. The data in this competition is the result of a laboratory simulation.

\section{TUTORIAL MATERIAL}
Paper should be tutorial in nature
Audience is data scientists of varying levels of knowledge. Keep newer students in mind
\section{DATA}
Must have section that defines data
Use tables and figures to illustrate data attributes
\section{METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS}
Define algorithms, methods and eperiments
DO NOT give play by play of everything we did
Dont put code in paper; if anything put in appendix.
Put versions of software but nop one cares about how to use technology; just state what we did.
\section{RESULTS}
Results of experiments
Use tables and graphs
Use tables and graphs
Use tables and graphs
Don't forget explanations
\section{ANALYSIS}
Analyze results.
These are NOT conclusions.
\section{ETHICS}
Discuss ethics of your problem
You MUST have ethics section.
\section{CONCLUSION}
Draw conclusionS (plural, more than one conclusion- minimum of 3)
This is NOT a summary section.
